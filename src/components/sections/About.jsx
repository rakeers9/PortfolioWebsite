        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p style={{ maxWidth: '600px', lineHeight: '1.6', marginTop: '1rem' }}>
          I'm a Computer Science major at Purdue University with a passion for building 
          AI-augmented systems that bridge real-world problems and scalable engineering solutions. 
          I've led machine learning and full-stack projects across research labs and companies 
          like Synechron, Yamaha, and John Deere â€” where I delivered impactful results like 
          reducing manufacturing scrap rates and automating resume screening pipelines. 
          Right now, I'm focused on building a fitness tracking app and experimenting with 
          cutting-edge AI technologies.
